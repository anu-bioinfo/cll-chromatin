#### uCLL vs mCLL

*De novo* motif analysis on differentially open chromatin site between uCLL and mCLL show enrichemnt for the PAX5 transcription factor (TF) [doi:10.1038/ni1454](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/ni1454).


The Forkhead transcription factor (TF) FOXO1 is also enriched, known to play a role in B cell and highly expressed in CD19+ B-cells, naive and memory and in cases of CLL [10.1182/blood-2011-09-381905](http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2011-09-381905). Interestingly, this TF seems to be a tumor supressor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Its role in CLL is yet illusive.


Go term enrichment:
"Rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity" and
"GTPase binding" -> proliferation [doi:10.1038/onc.2013.362](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/onc.2013.362)

"positive regulation of interleukin-2 biosynthetic process" -> [doi:10.1038/312641a0](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/312641a0)
